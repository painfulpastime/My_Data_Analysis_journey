# Mwaura Simon - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Simon! I am an Electrical Power Engineering student at the African Leadership University with an interest in Data Science and Machine Learning. I am looking to venture into the field of Power Analytics, fusing the two fields together. I am a digital artist during my free time, and I run my own Design Brand INCOGNITOâ„¢. I would love to collaborate and build with you, or just have coffee or beer. My email is simon.mwaura957@gmail.com.
